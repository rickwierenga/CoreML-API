# CoreML-API

Deploying CoreML models with Vapor to make them available to everyone.

This repository has the final source code for [this tutorial](https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/deploying-core-ml-models-using-vapor-c562a70b1371). You don't have to read the tutorial in order to use this project but I strongly recommend you read it if you want to learn how the app works.
